#Let's learn the basics of GitHub
-----------------------------------

#Create an account
#Make a repository

#Some must-have tools:
#vs-code and git bash (for Windows)

#To check the version
#git --version

#Configurations 
#(You can use following terminal commands to configure git for the repositories on your local machine)
#git config --global user.name "Any_Name" (--global for all the repositories present)
#git config --global user.email "email" 

#Cloning the repositories to the local machine.
#git clone https://some_name.git

#An essential thing to know is that git works in 2 step process:
#git add -> changes the working directory to the staging area. (Basically tells git what you'll be updating to a particular file in the next commit.)
#git commit -m "some_message" -> This creates the snapshot of changes made along with the timeline.

#After committing the changes we can push this repository to our GitHub account
#git push origin main

#Errors I faced and my solution
-------------------------------

#error: src refspec main does not match any
#error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/MHKace/Walkthroughs.git'

#Reason: This is the error I faced when I forgot to add and commit the changes before pushing.
#Solution: git add <file_name>
#          git commit -m "some message"
#          git push origin main
