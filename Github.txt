#Let's learn the basics of github
#Create an account
#Make a repository
#To make changes through local system clone the repository to the local machine
#git clone https://some_name.git


#A very important thing to know git works in 2 step process:
#git add -> adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. (Basically tells git what you'll be updating to a particular file in next commint.)
#git commit -m "some_message" -> this creates the snapshot of changes made along with the timeline.


#error: src refspec main does not match any
#error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/MHKace/Walkthroughs.git'
#This is the error you receive when you have not used commit command before pushing.
#You need to commit before pushing.
