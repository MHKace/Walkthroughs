#Let's learn the basics of GitHub
-----------------------------------

#Create an account
#Make a repository

#Some must-have tools:
#vs-code and git bash (for Windows)

#To check the version
#git --version

#Configurations 
#(You can use following terminal commands to configure git for the repositories on your local machine)
#git config --global user.name "Any_Name" (--global for all the repositories present)
#git config --global user.email "email" 

#Cloning the repositories to the local machine.
#git clone https://some_name.git

#An essential thing to know is that git works in 2 step process:
#git add -> changes the working directory to the staging area. (Basically tells git what you'll be updating to a particular file in the next commit.)
#git commit -m "some_message" -> This creates the snapshot of changes made along with the timeline.

#After committing the changes we can push this repository to our GitHub account
#git push origin main

#Sometimes making changes online is much easier than from the terminal or local machine in such cases your local machine won't push anything until your remote updates are synced with the local clone, for that we can use the following command to fetch and pull/download the contents of the remote repository and update the local repository to match the content
#git pull origin main



#Errors I faced and my solution
-------------------------------

#error: src refspec main does not match any
#error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/MHKace/Walkthroughs.git'

#Reason: This is the error I faced when I forgot to add and commit the changes before pushing.
#Solution: git add <file_name>
#          git commit -m "some message"
#          git push origin main
