# Cookies

Prerequisite:<br>
As for this, we don't require any specific tool, we'll be working with the inspect option available in our browser and Python scripting (not mandatory). <br><br>

Observation: <br>
On visiting the provided link to the challenge <a href="http://mercury.picoctf.net:<port>/"> http://mercury.picoctf.net:<port>/ </a> we can observe a landing page with the text "Welcome to my cookie search page. See how much I like different kinds of cookies!" and a text input field to insert some text.<br>

<br>
Now at first, we can play around with some random words and it gives us "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie."<br>
Upon entering the suggested word "snickerdoodle" we can see it prompts "That is a cookie! Not very special though..." <br>
By this time I am confused as to what to do?? <br>

Solution:<br>
Reading the names of these challenges with utmost care has been a key for me as this helps in narrowing down possibilities that we need to work around. <br>
As the challenge talks about cookies, we can deduce it has something to do with web cookies. So the next step we do is to inspect the page and those who are not very familiar with the inspect option in browsers you'll find most of your answers in the Additional Read section below. <br>
When we gave some random text, the value of the cookie was set to "-1". Similarly when the suggested word was entered the cookie value changed to "0". <br>
Now again in inspect > storage > cookies, we changed the value of the cookie to "1". Firstly it felt like nothing changed but I noticed it changed the text displayed on every reload with every change in the cookie value.<br>
For cookie "name=1", "I love chocolate chip cookies!"<br>
For cookie "name=2", "I love oatmeal raisin cookies!" <br>
...<br>
...<br>
Now I knew that I might need a correct value to get the flag to solve this challenge. So I started incrementing the value manually and kept looking for the output and after a dozen tries I received the flag to complete this solution.<br>
But, being a fan of automation, the following script can be used to get the flag in no time. The library imported is explained in the Additional Read section below, <br>
