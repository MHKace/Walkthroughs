# Insp3ct0r

Prerequisite:<br>
IDK. I guess a bit about the inspect element feature of the browser and lots of curiosity. :)

Observation: <br>
On visiting the provided link to the challenge <a href=" https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/">  https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ </a> we can observe a landing page made by Kishor Balan (as mentioned in the challenge statement), he also tipped us that his code might need an inspection, which gave me the major hints about what to do in this challenge.<br>

Now at first, we can play around with the web application, it tells us the following details:<br>
"What?  I made a website" <br>
"How?  I used these to make this site: HTML, CSS, JS (JavaScript)" <br>

Solution:<br>
While following my usual approach I found all the pieces of the flag required and a tip I would like to give is in CTFs and challenges problem statement is the biggest clue. Moving towards the flag I have divided the hunt into three steps.<br>
1. Checking source code for juicy or informative comments is the first thing hitting our minds. (I hope you received 1/3 of your strings for the flag) <br>
2. We got the first part in HTML second thing we can check for is for all the source files as our friend Kishor Balan has mentioned he used HTML, CSS and JS for his web application, so to view the CSS file follow the following path Inspect > Style Editor > Mycss.css  (I hope you received 2/3 of your strings for the flag) <br>
3. On seeing the pattern of this challenge we understood that the next piece of string would be in the js file used to make the web application, so for that we can find it at Inspect > Debugger > Sources > <Some_Dropdowns...> > myjs.js  (I hope you received 3/3 of your strings for the flag) <br>

Concatenate all three pieces and you'll have the flag to solve this challenge.
