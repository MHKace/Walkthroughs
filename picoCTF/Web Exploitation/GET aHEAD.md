# GET aHEAD

Prerequisite:<br>
Tools required burp suite.

Observation: <br>
We have a web application featuring two buttons, each labeled with a color name, and clicking these buttons triggers a change in the background color of the page.<br>

The web application is designed with two buttons. One button initiates a GET request, while the other triggers a POST request when clicked. The result of these requests is a change in the background color of the page.

Solution:<br>
There may be alternative approaches to address this challenge, but the one I find preferable involves capturing the requests generated by clicking the buttons on the website using BurpSuite. For Burp Suite, consult my Burpsuite module.

Upon inspecting the requests and responses, everything appears normal and there are no apparent anomalies. The challenge's name is intriguing, as it suggests a connection to HTTP request methods such as GET and POST. Given that HEAD is also an HTTP request method, let's experiment with manipulating the HTTP request method.

Upon inspecting the response to these requests, it appears that there is valuable information for us.

Additional Reading:
<br><br>
HTTP Request Headers Simplified:<br>

GET: This method retrieves information/data for the specified resource. Data passed to parameters through a GET request is conveyed in the request/response URL. It should be exclusively used for data retrieval.

POST: This method sends data to the server, primarily utilized with HTML forms. It has the potential to alter server data, and the type of data being sent can be verified in the Content-Type header.

HEAD: This method retrieves the response without the body content.

OPTIONS: This method retrieves permitted communication methods for a given URL.

DELETE: If employed, this method deletes the specified resource from the destination server. Access to the DELETE method is typically blocked or blacklisted from the client side due to potentially significant implications on the entity's business.

CONNECT: Used to establish two-way connections, potentially opening a tunnel. For instance, a client can request a proxy server to establish a connection to a destination server on its behalf and relay the TCP stream after the connection is established.

PUT: This method is employed to create or replace a resource on the server. While it is idempotent, signifying that repeated requests yield the same result, it is not considered safe. This is because it could potentially allow malicious users to upload harmful files to the server or update existing files.

TRACE: This method serves the purpose of message loopback. It proves useful in diagnosing the route if any changes are made in the process.

Idempotent Methods:<br>
This is a term we would observe in many online resources used in describing HTTP request methods.
Idempotent methods are the methods which on being executed once or n number of times result in the same output or output does not change.
