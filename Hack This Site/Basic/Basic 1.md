# Basic 1 <br>

Level 1(the idiot test)<br>
The challenge states the following,<br> <br>
<em>"This level is what we call "The Idiot Test" If you can't complete it, don't give up on learning all you can, but, don't go begging someone else for the answer, that one way to get you hated/made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue."</em>

The initial step I take when testing or solving a web-related challenge is to inspect the source code. Developers frequently include information for other developers in the source code, and there are instances where the removal of such information might be overlooked by the developer.
<br>
<br>
I assume some of you may have already figured out what needs to be done. However, for those who are still unsure about this challenge, I encourage you to proceed with this walkthrough.
<br>

Click on Basic 1 you'll be redirected to a page that looks something like this,

<br>
As we can see it states we need to enter a password to continue, and the Help! states "If you have no idea, learn HTML."
<br>
Going by book nothing fancy, and let's view the source code for this page....
<br>
That's a lot of code, we don't need to go through everything here, so we would just find (Ctrl + F) a keyword, I'll search for "password:".
<br>
You will observe certain elements that are not visible in the browser but can be instrumental in documenting your HTML source code with the necessary information.
<br><br>
Hence we completed the Idiot Test.
